This website was created with the help of BOOTSTRAP and is coded with SUBLIME TEXT. Templates for the portfolio was carousel, a modal from the cheatsheet, and gallery. 

The main homepage of my website consists of the carousel that features a very small summary of the creator- which is me. The images of my carousel are some of my artworks to which I also feature in my Gallery. The carousel also has buttons that leads to the webpage of my Gallery. 

The rest of the homepage features other information of what I can do- which includes my capabiliy of drawing comics, animating characters, and programming (slightly skilled). Unfortunately my works when it comes to programming have become inaccessible due to my other device being unavailable or broken. However if you're reading this, I've only created one program and its a calendar from january to december. 

The next page shows the creator's Gallery, which features his artwork that ranged from his commission work, school art projects, and his personal works. Personal works include the artwork of the creator's original characters including Kai and Seb- Kai being the creator's favorite character among all of his characters. Unfortunately, it is not possible to feature all of my characters in a single gallery and other characters still need to be drawn. (Perhaps in another website in another time, I will create a dedicated portfolio for my characters.) 

Other content include the commission works which feature their original characters. The creator is paid for him to draw their characters in requested backgrounds, poses, outfits and prompts. 

Lastly the Gallery only includes one school project and it was an artwork of me and my boyfriend. Thank you besties.
